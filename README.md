### Using the TL model of miniML
miniML is a deep learning model developed by O’Neill et al. (2023). The link to the original Github is:
https://github.com/delvendahl/miniML/tree/main

The code here in this repository mostly contains the code from the main repository of the authors with some changes (added as comments in the individual files). 
The TL approach was used to train miniML to apply it to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. 
Example recording files were too big to upload. Please contact me if you need them.
